## authnc Plugin for DokuWiki

This small authentication plugin for the [DokuWiki](http://www.dokuwiki.org)
which uses a Nextcloud instance as authentication backend.

**This is mostly work in progress**

##### Remarks

* This plugin uses the [`OCS-API`](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/developer_manual/client_apis/OCS/ocs-api-overview.html) from Nextcloud to authorize new users.
* At the moment only `trustExternal`, `logout`, `getGroups` and `getUserCount` are implemented
* `getUsers` is somewhat broken, atm (too many requests)
* The API may behave slowly
* ATM, there are no tests, it was programmed against a live instance with a simple dw instance, see submodules (do not checkout)
* ~The login form throws a `failure 998` invalid syntax, see [this](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/open-collaboration-services/)~

##### ToDo

* [x] Only allow login for enabled users
* allow only specific groups to login
* allow bidirectional user changes 

##### Usage notes

* To use ACL create the appropriate groups within your NC instance and assign it to your users
* Set the groups within the DokuWiki config to manager or users
* Use the ACL as usually

#### Installation notes

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/authnc/ - if the folder is called different it
will not work!
